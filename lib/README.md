Server Side
========
The server for Browsercraft is based on NodeJS and Socket.IO. Here, objects
are maintained as JavaScript classes and passed to the client as JSON objects.
Game updates happen in the game loop in server.js but all methods for updating
objects are defined in the respective objects.

All other classes are self-explanatory by their name.
